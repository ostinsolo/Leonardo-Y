## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ROADMAP (Current Phase + Next Steps)**

### **CURRENT PHASE: 🔧 FINAL PRODUCTION POLISH** *(80% → 100%)*
*Priority: HIGH - Complete the remaining 20% for full production readiness*

#### **🎯 KEY INSIGHT DISCOVERED:**
**Leonardo's architecture is proven sound!** DeepSearcher success shows that when tools are properly implemented, Leonardo produces intelligent, contextual responses. The issue is not the architecture - it's individual tool implementations.

#### **Remaining Tasks (Final 20%):**
- **🧠 Memory Tool Enhancement**: Fix recall_memory to return actual stored data instead of generic responses
- **🔄 Contextual Follow-ups**: Enhance rule-based planner for multi-turn conversation context
- **🔍 Verification Layer**: Fix `'ExecutionResult' object has no attribute 'get'` error
- **📊 Tool Quality Audit**: Apply DeepSearcher-level intelligence to remaining tools

#### **Success Criteria:**
- Memory tools return actual recalled information ("Alex", "software developer")
- Follow-up questions use context from previous responses
- All verification layer errors resolved
- 90%+ intelligent response rate across all tools
